This subdirectory (cmcm) contains Cmajor compiler written in Cmajor.

It is manually translated from C++ code to Cmajor code so that the
algorithms and data structures of the compiler are the same.
Hopefully I'm not making many new bugs.

The Cmajor version about 2.6 times slower that the C++ version,
but at least it's a starting point.

To compile debug version of the compiler using LLVM backend compile with:
cmc [-R] cmcm.cms

To compile release version of the compiler using LLVM backend compile with:
cmc [-R] -config=release cmcm.cms

To compile debug version of the compiler using C backend compile with:
cmc [-R] -backend=c cmcm.cms

To compile release version of the compiler using LLVM backend compile with:
cmc [-R] -config=release -backend=c cmcm.cms
