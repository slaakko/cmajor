This subdirectory (cmcm) contains Cmajor compiler written in Cmajor.

It is manually translated from C++ code to Cmajor code so that the
algorithms and data structures of the compiler are the same.
Hopefully I'm not making any new bugs compared to the C++ version.

The performance of it is considerably poorer compared to C++ version,
but at least it's a starting point to a path to convert C++ versions
of Cmajor tool chain to Cmajor programs.

To compile debug version of the compiler using LLVM backend compile with:
cmc [-R] cmcm.cms

To compile release version of the compiler using LLVM backend compile with:
cmc [-R] -config=release cmcm.cms

To compile debug version of the compiler using C backend compile with:
cmc [-R] -backend=c cmcm.cms

To compile release version of the compiler using LLVM backend compile with:
cmc [-R] -config=release -backend=c cmcm.cms
