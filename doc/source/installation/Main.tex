\author{Seppo Laakko}
\maketitle

\section{Installation in Windows}

\subsection{Prerequisites}

Note:
You must uninstall any previous Cmajor version before installing
this version (1.2.0).

It is also recommended that you delete the
\verb|%APPDATA%\Cmajor| directory before installing
this version.

\begin{itemize}

\item
Download and install MinGW-w64 GCC:\\
\url{http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files/Toolchains%20targetting%20Win32/Personal%20Builds/mingw-builds/installer/mingw-w64-install.exe/download}

Installation settings for my system (64-bit Windows):
\begin{itemize}
\item
Version 5.1.0
\item
Architecture: x86\_64
\item
Threads: \textbf{posix}
\item
Exception: sjlj
\item
Build revision: 0
\end{itemize}

Installation settings for 32-bit Windows:
\begin{itemize}
\item
Version 5.1.0
\item
Architecture: i686
\item
Threads: \textbf{posix}
\item
Exception: sjlj
\item
Build revision: 0
\end{itemize}

Note: Threads setting must be ``posix''.

After installation insert the bin-directory to the \textbf{PATH} environment variable.
In my system this is\\
\verb|C:\Program Files\mingw-w64\x86_64-5.1.0-posix-sjlj-rt_v4-rev0\mingw64\bin| directory.

\item
Download and install Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015:\\
64-bit: \url{http://sourceforge.net/projects/cmajor/files/1.2.0/vcredist_x64.exe/download}\\
32-bit: \url{http://sourceforge.net/projects/cmajor/files/1.2.0/vcredist_x86.exe/download}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Cmajor Installation}

\begin{itemize}

\item
Download and run \textbf{cmajor-1.2.0-win-x86-setup.exe} (for 32-bit Windows) or
\textbf{cmajor-1.2.0-win-x64-setup.exe} (for 64-bit Windows).

\item
Cmajor is installed by default to \verb|C:\Program Files\Cmajor| directory (under 32-bit Windows) or
to \verb|C:\Program Files (x86)\Cmajor| directory (32-bit and 64-bit versions under 64-bit Windows).

Note: The x64 version is also installed by default under
\verb|C:\Program Files (x86)| directory although the programs are genuingly 64-bit versions).
This is due to restrictions of InstallShield Limited Edition.

\item
The setup adds \verb|C:\Program Files\Cmajor\bin| directory or \\
\verb|C:\Program Files (x86)\Cmajor\bin| directory
to your system's \textbf{PATH} environment variable, so the Cmajor programs can be executed from any
directory from the command prompt without specifying full paths.

\item
The setup also adds a \textbf{CM\_LIBRARY\_PATH} environment variable and
sets it to contain a path to the Cmajor System Library directory
that is \verb|%APPDATA%\Cmajor\system|. If you need to modify the
\textbf{CM\_LIBRARY\_PATH} environment variable, you can find it from the Advanced System Settings pane in the System Control Panel.

In my computer the \verb|%APPDATA%| points actually to the
\verb|C:\Users\Seppo\AppData\Roaming\| directory. The \textbf{AppData} folder
is hidden by default. To see it you will have to modify the settings in
the \emph{Folder Options} Control Panel.

\item
The setup adds an icon to \textbf{Cmajor Development Environment} to the desktop.

\item
After installation you have to build the Cmajor System Library.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Building the Cmajor System Library}

\begin{itemize}

\item
Option 1: using IDE:\\

Start \textbf{Cmajor Development Environment}.

\begin{itemize}

\item
Open the \verb!File|Built-in Projects|System Library! project.

\item
Choose \verb!Build|Batch build...! command

\item
Click the \verb|Select All| button or
select the configurations you plan to use.

\item
Click the Rebuild... button.

\item
Now the Cmajor system is ready for building user projects.

\end{itemize}

Option 2: using batch file:

\begin{itemize}

\item
Open command prompt and change to Cmajor system directory by issuing command
\verb|cd %APPDATA%\Cmajor\system|.

\item
Run \textbf{build.bat}.
This builds the Cmajor System Libary for each backend (LLVM/C) and
configuration (debug/release/profile/full).

\item
Now the Cmajor system is ready for building user projects.

\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Troubleshooting}

\begin{itemize}

\item
\textbf{library reference 'system.cml' not found.}

You have to build the System Library for the used configuration (debug/release/profile/full) and backend (LLVM/C) first.

\item

\textbf{gcc is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.}

or \textbf{'ar' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.}

or \textbf{Cannot start llc.exe because libgcc\_s\_sjlj-1.dll is missing}.

The bin directory of mingw-w64\\
(in my machine\\
\verb|C:\Program Files\mingw-w64\x86_64-5.1.0-posix-sjlj-rt_v4-rev0\mingw64\bin|)
must be in the PATH environment variable.

\item
\textbf{undefined reference to `WinMain' collect2.exe: error: ld returned 1 exit status}

You have probably 32-bit Cmajor and 64-bit MinGW-w64's gcc.
Both must be either 32-bit or 64-bit.

\item
Build seems to succeed but program does not work, or other mysterious error.

Try \textbf{rebuild} command (-R option) or \textbf{clean} and then \textbf{build}.

\item
IDE messes up things.

Try using the command line compiler (cmc.exe).

\item
How to generate 32-bit executables in a 64-bit system.

Use 32-bit MinGW-w64 (i686) and 32-bit Cmajor.
\end{itemize}

\section{Installation in Linux}

\subsection{Prerequisites}

\begin{itemize}

\item
GCC\\
Must be recent enough to compile C++11 code.

\item
Download, build and install Boost (\url{http://www.boost.org/}).
At minimum you will need to build and install the
\textbf{filesystem} and \textbf{iostreams} libraries:\\
(\verb|./b2 --with-filesystem --with-iostreams install|)

\item
Donwload, build and install LLVM tools (\url{http://llvm.org/}).
Installation instructions can be found in \url{http://llvm.org/docs/GettingStarted.html} document.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Cmajor Installation}

\begin{itemize}

\item
Download and extract \textbf{cmajor-1.2.0-src.tar.gz} to some directory here called \verb|<cmajor>|.

\item
Change to \verb|<cmajor>| directory and run \verb|make| and then \verb|[sudo] make install|.

\item
Set an environment variable \verb|CM_LIBRARY_PATH| to contain path to \verb|<cmajor>/system| directory.
You may want to insert a statement like:\\
\verb|export CM_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/cmajor/system|\\
into you .bashrc script.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Building the System Library}

\begin{itemize}

\item
Run command \verb|make sys| from \verb|<cmajor>| directory.

\item
Now the Cmajor system is ready for building user projects.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Troubleshooting}

\begin{itemize}

\item
library reference 'system.cml' not found

You have to build the System Library for the used configuration (debug/release/profile/full) and backend (LLVM/C) first.

\item
sh: 1: llc: not found

You have probably not installed LLVM tools.

\item
Build seems to succeed but program does not work, or other mysterious error.

Try \textbf{rebuild} command (-R option) or \textbf{clean} and then \textbf{build}.

\item
Ubuntu Document Viewer does not show PDF documents included in Cmajor.

At least \textbf{okular} shows them beautifully.

\end{itemize}
